When do you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?

I will want to create a remote repository whenever I want to share or work with another
person or if I want to use as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I don't want to bring some changes from the remote to my local repository.
