When do you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?

I will want to create a remote repository whenever I want to share or work with another
person or if I want to use as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I don't want to bring some changes from the remote to my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

Forks: used when i want to make a copy from a GitHub repository to another GitHub
repository

Clones: when I want to coppy a project from one place to another, usually GitHub to
local computer or between local computers

Branches: is a sequence of commits that one project has.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
locally?

It creates a link between my updates with others that could be generated from
other collaborators.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
Of course with git and github are easier. If i don't use these resources I
would have to create different folder for each "commit" I would make and
I would need to check all the changes mannualy.
