What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I creates a hidden folder called .git. This folder is going to have
all the history of the files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a temporary area I can keep my files before a commit. I can make
one commit with more than one file and keep my files safe while i am
working on them befere a logic unit is done.
