What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I creates a hidden folder called .git. This folder is going to have
all the history of the files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a temporary area I can keep my files before a commit. I can make
one commit with more than one file and keep my files safe while i am
working on them befere a logic unit is done.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

I would add only the files that makes sense for the logical change
I want to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?


Branches would be helpful when I'll try some new things or if I am
making a different version of the project I am working on.
In this case, it would be separated from the original version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams make easier to illustrate and undertand the branches in
your project.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

When you merge two branches, all the updates made on both branches,
are put together in one commit. Also the branch that is receiving
the updates becames the parent for the commits from the old branch.
All the commits will be in the same tree.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always
doing merges manually?
pros - when git can do the merge automaticaly you can save the
time and changes of making mistakes while merging files
cons - whenever it's not possible to find out the merge we
have to do it manually.
